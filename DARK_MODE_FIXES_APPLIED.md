## Specific Components to Fix in Each File

### For Dashboard Files (Complete & Fixed Unified)
- [ ] Date range selector dropdown
- [ ] Custom date inputs
- [ ] Metric cards backgrounds and text
- [ ] Chart containers
- [ ] Empty state messages
- [ ] Report type buttons
- [ ] Category sections

### For TripPnlReportsPage
- [ ] Summary cards (Total Income, Total Expense, Net Profit, Total Trips)
- [ ] Chart containers (Monthly Trend, Profit/Loss Distribution, Vehicle Performance)
- [ ] Filter section background
- [ ] Filter input fields and dropdowns
- [ ] Quick filter chips
- [ ] Trip details table
- [ ] Table headers and rows
- [ ] Pagination controls
- [ ] Trip modal

### For Report Templates
- [ ] Report container background
- [ ] StatCard components (if not using the fixed StatCard)
- [ ] Table containers
- [ ] Table headers and cells
- [ ] Section backgrounds (summary stats, performance insights, etc.)
- [ ] Badge/tag colors
- [ ] Icon backgrounds

## Testing Checklist
After fixing all files, test the following:

### Light Mode
- [ ] All cards have white backgrounds
- [ ] Text is clearly visible (dark on light)
- [ ] Borders are subtle but visible
- [ ] Icons have proper colors
- [ ] Tables are readable

### Dark Mode
- [ ] All cards have dark backgrounds (gray-900)
- [ ] Text is clearly visible (light on dark)
- [ ] Borders are visible (gray-700/600)
- [ ] Icons maintain proper contrast
- [ ] Tables are readable
- [ ] No white flashes or light backgrounds
- [ ] Charts are visible (may need special handling)

## Next Steps
1. Complete FixedUnifiedReportingDashboard.tsx (similar to CompleteFixed)
2. Fix TripPnlReportsPage.tsx (large file, many sections)
3. Fix each report template file (smaller, simpler patterns)

## Notes
- All date/time pickers need `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800` and `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100`
- All select elements need the same treatment
- Chart containers may need special handling for recharts dark mode
- Empty states should use `text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400`
- Hover states on buttons should account for dark mode: `hover:bg-gray-50 dark:hover:bg-gray-800`
