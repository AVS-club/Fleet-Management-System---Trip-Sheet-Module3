I notice that the original file content appears to be empty, but the diff is trying to modify some JSX code with toggle switch styling. Since there's no original content provided, I cannot generate the complete file content that would result from applying this diff.

The diff appears to be making no actual changes (the lines being removed and added are identical), so even if I had the original content, the result would be the same as the original.

Without the original file content, I cannot provide the complete corrected file.
