# Apply Migration to Remove Transport Business Limits

## What This Migration Does

This migration removes unrealistic validation limits that were preventing your transport business from saving trips:

1. **Removes 2000 km distance limit** - Transport trucks can travel much more than 2000 km in a single trip
2. **Removes 30 km/L mileage limit** - Two-wheelers and efficient vehicles can exceed this
3. **Increases trip duration limit** from 48 hours to 168 hours (1 week) for long-haul transport

## How to Apply

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**
4. Open the file: `supabase/migrations/20251023000000_remove_transport_business_limits.sql`
5. Copy the entire contents and paste into the SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** to execute the migration

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI

If you have Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\Users\nishi\OneDrive\Desktop\Fleet-Management-System---Trip-Sheet-Module3-main (2)\Fleet-Management-System---Trip-Sheet-Module3"

# Apply the migration
supabase db push
```

## After Applying the Migration

1. Refresh your browser
2. Try creating the trip again with 2615 km distance
3. The validation error should no longer appear
4. The trip should save successfully

## Changes Made

### Database Validation (Trigger)
- ❌ Removed: 2000 km maximum distance check
- ❌ Removed: 30 km/L maximum mileage check
- ✅ Added: More reasonable 5000 km warning threshold
- ✅ Added: 100 km/L warning threshold (instead of hard limit)
- ✅ Increased: Trip duration from 48h to 168h (1 week)

### Frontend Validation (TripForm.tsx)
- ❌ Removed: 30 km/L error that blocked submission
- ✅ Changed to: 100 km/L warning (allows submission)

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to rollback this migration, you can re-run the original validation:

```sql
-- This would restore the old limits
-- (Not recommended for transport business)
```
