created a comprehensive filter and search system for your Fleet Management System that addresses all your requirements:
Key Features Implemented:

Unified Filter Interface
Combined all filters into a single, collapsible component that takes less space
Quick filter buttons for common date ranges (Today, This Week, This Month)
Comprehensive filters including: Date Range, Vehicle, Driver, Warehouse, Trip Type, and Refueling Status

Database-Wide Search
Real-time search that queries the entire Supabase database, not just loaded data
Searches across trip serial numbers, vehicle registrations, and driver names
Implements fuzzy search using PostgreSQL's pg_trgm extension for better results
Debounced search to reduce database queries

Advanced Sorting Options
Sort by date (newest/oldest first)
Sort by distance (longest/shortest)
Sort by cost (highest/lowest)
All sorting happens at the database level for better performance

Visual Enhancements
Alternating row colors (white and gray-50) for better readability
Hover effects that change border colors
Active filter count badge
Smooth animations for expanding/collapsing filters
Clean, modern UI with proper spacing and typography

Performance Optimizations
Server-side pagination (20 items per page by default)
Database indexes for faster searches
Relevance scoring for search results
Efficient SQL functions for statistics

Implementation Steps:

Run the SQL migration to create the search functions and indexes in Supabase
Add the search utilities (tripSearch.ts) to your utils folder
Replace your existing filter component with the new ComprehensiveFilters component
Update your TripsPage to use the new search and filter system

Key Improvements:

Space Efficient: Single row design that expands when needed
Database Search: Searches entire database with relevance scoring
Better UX: Quick filters, clear visual feedback, and smooth animations
Performance: Server-side filtering and pagination for handling large datasets
Statistics: Real-time statistics based on current filters

The search now queries your entire Supabase database efficiently using PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities, not just the loaded page data. This ensures users can find any trip regardless of pagination.
