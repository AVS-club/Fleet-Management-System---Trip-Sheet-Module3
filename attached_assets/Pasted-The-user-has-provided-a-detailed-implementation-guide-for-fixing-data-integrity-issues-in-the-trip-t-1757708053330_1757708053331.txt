The user has provided a detailed implementation guide for fixing data integrity issues in the trip tracking system. They want me to implement this in three phases. Let me look at the attached file to understand what needs to be done.

Looking at the file, it appears to be a comprehensive guide with 10 different fixes for data integrity issues. The document shows:

Fix 1: Odometer Continuity Validation
Fix 2: Concurrent Trip Prevention
Fix 3: Mileage Calculation Chain Integrity
...and more
The user wants me to implement these fixes in three phases. Let me first check for any LSP errors that need to be fixed, then create a task list for implementing these fixes in phases.

I see there are 32 LSP diagnostics in TripForm.tsx. Let me check those first before proceeding with the implementation.

I'll implement the trip system data integrity fixes in three phases as requested. Let me first check the LSP errors and then create a comprehensive task list for the implementation.

Checked code issues

Planned phased implementation task list
Let me read the full implementation guide to understand all the fixes needed:


Planned phased data integrity fixes
Now let me organize all 10 fixes from the implementation guide and create a comprehensive task list divided into three phases:

Created task list

Delegated odometer continuity validation
Excellent! I'll implement the Trip System Data Integrity Fixes in three systematic phases. I've created a comprehensive task list with all 10 fixes:

Implementation Plan Overview:
Phase 1: Critical Validation Fixes (Tasks 1-3)
Odometer Continuity Validation
Concurrent Trip Prevention
Mileage Chain Integrity
Phase 2: Data Quality Improvements (Tasks 4-6)
Unrealistic Value Detection
Data Correction Cascade Management
Serial Number Sequence Monitoring
Phase 3: Advanced Features (Tasks 7-10)
Return Trip Validation
Fuel Efficiency Baseline Management
Edge Case Handling
Audit Trail Implementation
Let me start with Phase 1, Task 1: Implementing Odometer Continuity Validation.


Implementing odometer validation

Agent ran into an error

Found the correct Supabase path
Let me find the correct path for the supabase client:


Searched for "Find the supabase client import location and configuration"

Delegated task with correct information

Implemented odometer continuity validation

Decided on continuity validation approach

Check car mileage is sequential

Delegated concurrent trip prevention task
Now let me implement Phase 1, Fix 2: Concurrent Trip Prevention.


Implemented concurrent trip prevention logic

Planned next fix implementation

Stop overlapping driver trips

Planned mileage chain integrity fix
Now let me implement Phase 1, Fix 3: Mileage Chain Integrity.


Ensured mileage calculation chain integrity

Planned next phase of work
Excellent progress! I've successfully completed Phase 1 of the Trip System Data Integrity Fixes. Here's what has been implemented:

✅ Phase 1 Complete - Critical Validation Fixes
Fix 1: Odometer Continuity Validation ✓
Validates sequential odometer readings between trips
Prevents illogical readings (start < previous end)
Warns about large gaps (>50km) but allows flexibility
Auto-suggests correct values with user confirmation
Fix 2: Concurrent Trip Prevention ✓
Prevents overlapping vehicle assignments
Prevents overlapping driver assignments
Shows clear conflict details with trip serial numbers
Real-time validation with proper date comparisons
Fix 3: Mileage Chain Integrity ✓
Protects refueling trip dependencies
Implements soft delete for critical trips
Shows affected trips before deletion
Preserves mileage calculation accuracy

Keep refueling trips linked

Delegated Fix 4 - Unrealistic Value Detection
Now let's continue with Phase 2: Data Quality Improvements. Starting with Fix 4: Unrealistic Value Detection.


Implemented unrealistic value detection

Planned next task after fix 4

Check fuel and distance limits

Corrected cascade management logic
Continuing with Phase 2, Fix 5: Data Correction Cascade Management.


Implementing data correction cascade
